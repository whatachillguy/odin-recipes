        <p>An Italian beef sandwich, originating in Chicago, is composed of thin slices of seasoned roast beef, simmered and served au jus on a long French roll. The sandwich's history dates back at least to the 1930s. The bread itself is, at the diner's preference, often dipped (or double-dipped) into the juice the meat is cooked in, and the sandwich is typically topped off with Chicago-style giardiniera (called "hot") or sauteed, with green Italian sweet peppers (called "sweet").</p>

            <li>Turano roll</li>

        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Let the meat rest at room temperature for 15 minutes (this is a good time to measure your other spices and seasonings). Season the beef all over with kosher salt.</li>
            <li>Heat a large skillet or Dutch oven over medium-high. Once it is hot, sear the meat on all sides until golden brown, moving it as little as possible so that it develops a nice crust (this will take about 10 minutes). Transfer to the slow cooker.</li>
            <li>Turn the heat to medium. Carefully splash in some of the broth and with a wooden spoon, scrape up the brown bits on the bottom of the pan (this is FLAVOR). Pour the liquid and any bits into the slow cooker on top of the beef.</li>
            <li>In a small bowl, stir together the seasoning ingredients: Italian seasoning, granulated sugar, garlic powder, onion powder, salt, black pepper, and thyme. Sprinkle on top of the beef.</li>
            <li>Add the pepperoncini peppers and juice. Add the giardiniera (do not add any giardiniera juice).</li>
        </ol>
